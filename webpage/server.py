# ARDUINO CONFIGURATION
# Set ARDUINO_MDNS_NAME to the MDNS name of the Arduino (by default arduino.local),
# and keep ARDUINO_IP equal to None to have the server attempt to resolve the Arduino
# IP address automatically.  If this resolution fails, you can set the ARDUINO_IP value
# manually below to the IP (as a string, for example '192.168.1.100') to skip the MDNS
# lookup.
# - On Windows you need Bonjour installed to resolve MDNS names.  You can install it from
#   here with the Bonjour Print Services for Windows download: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999
# - On Linux Bonjour support is likely installed already (if you use Ubuntu for example).
#   If not, install Avahi: http://avahi.org/
# - On Mac OSX Bonjour is installed automatically.
